# Machine Learning 

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository on Machine Learning!

In this repository, you will find my work and projects related to machine learning. I have been exploring this field for a while and have created a variety of projects that showcase different concepts and techniques in machine learning.

Some of the topics covered in this repository include:

## Machine Learning Introduction:

A course on the fundamentals of machine-learning from @kaggle. Hands-on projects where I learned model validation concepts, how to calculate mean absolute error (MAE), how to compare different decision trees sizes and other important skills.
